"""LVN Phase 2 — the pure lane-journal progress fold (docs/82, journal_delta.py).

`journal_delta.fold_since` grounds the liveness verdict's heartbeat + lease-event
evidence in the lane journal so the SPINNING-vs-STALLED line comes from kernel
evidence, not a caller-supplied number. These tests pin the fold on FROZEN entry
lists (no disk, the `lane_journal.replay()` discipline) — the journal read is the
CLI's boundary job; the fold is pure.

The hard problem the fold resolves: a journal entry carries NO run-id (only a
`(loop_ts, lane)` lease key), so "did THIS run move?" is attributed on two axes —
IDENTITY (scoped to this run's `lease_key`; **required** — no host-wide guess) and
TIME (the entry's own append `ts`, strict `>` the floored run start for the
ADVANCING-gating event rung). Every degrade fails toward STALLED/SPINNING.
