"""journal-delta — the lane-journal progress fold for the liveness verdict.

docs/82, LVN **Phase 2** — the journal + heartbeat rungs. Phase 1's heartbeat
age was caller-supplied (`--last-heartbeat-age-ms`); this grounds the heartbeat
and the lease-layer-event signal in the **lane journal** so the
SPINNING-vs-STALLED distinction comes from kernel evidence the agent can't
forge, not a passed number.

This module is `git_delta`'s sibling — the same boundary/evidence split LVN
Phase 1b established (`docs/82` 1b): the file read (`lane_journal.read_all`)
happens at the CLI boundary; the **fold here is PURE** — entries in, two numbers
out, the clock injected, no disk. It is replay-testable on frozen entry lists
exactly like `lane_journal.replay()`, which is what lets the whole liveness
ladder be tested without a live multi-minute agent run (the `loop_decide` design
value, restated for the temporal axis). `liveness.classify` stays byte-pure with
zero journal-schema awareness: Phase 2 only changes WHERE its two journal inputs
(`journal_events_since`, `last_heartbeat_age_ms`) come from.

It imports only stdlib + the lane-journal *op constants + identity helper* it
needs (the `OP_*` names + `_lease_identity`) — a one-way sibling-kernel import
(the same arrow `timeline`→`git_delta` has). It is
**never** imported BY `lane_journal` (whose job is lease correctness + replay,
not `ProgressEvidence`-shaped clock semantics).

THE HARD PROBLEM this fold resolves: a journal entry carries **no run-id** — it
is keyed only by `(loop_ts, lane)` (`lane_journal._lease_identity`). So "did
THIS run move?" cannot be answered from the journal by time alone — a busy
*neighbor* lane would otherwise manufacture a false ADVANCING for a spinning
run. The fold attributes on **two axes**:

  * IDENTITY — every journal rung is scoped to THIS run's lease, passed as
    `lease_key=(loop_ts, lane)`. Only entries whose `_lease_identity` matches
    contribute. **Identity is REQUIRED**: with `lease_key=None` the journal
    rungs do not engage at all (events forced to 0, no heartbeat) — there is no
    host-wide "is *some* lane alive" guess (that signal is too ambiguous to
    certify *this* run). The bare `dos liveness --run-id … --start-sha …`
    North-star form still answers from the commit rung; identity only unlocks
    the *journal* rungs. (Operator choice, 2026-06-01: require identity always.)
  * TIME — among identity-matched entries, an entry's **own append `ts`**
    (never the self-reported, copy-prone `heartbeat_at`) decides whether it
    falls in the run's window.

THE ROUNDING RULE — different per rung, deliberately:

  * EVENT rung (gates ADVANCING; over-counting is FORBIDDEN, docs/82 2c):
    a **bounded window** `(floored start, now + slack]` AND a **lease-birth
    exclusion**. The window is strictly after the run-start floored to its
    containing second (journal `ts` is second-resolution, the run-start is ms) AND
    no later than now plus the same one-second future slack the heartbeat rung
    uses. The lease-birth exclusion drops the FIRST ACQUIRE for this lease — the
    lease coming into existence is not progress on it — by IDENTITY, independent of
    its timestamp (a later re-ACQUIRE after a RELEASE still counts). A same-second
    *pre-start* op is NOT counted (the floor lower bound); the run's own
    establishing ACQUIRE is NOT counted (the birth exclusion); an implausibly
    future-dated op (clock skew / forgery / cross-host merge) is NOT counted (the
    upper bound). Because events ≥1 is the *top-of-ladder* ADVANCING verdict — the
    most consequential — this rung is the BEST-guarded, not the worst: every
    excluded op fails toward SPINNING/STALLED (safe), never invents ADVANCING. This
    fixes "a same-second pre-start op fabricates ADVANCING", "a lone boundary
    ACQUIRE marks a held-but-idle lane ADVANCING forever" (now by identity, so it
    holds even when the ACQUIRE lands seconds after the run-id mint — the real
    dispatch timeline the old `> floor` rule missed), AND "a future-skewed event
    fabricates ADVANCING on a stuck run".
  * HEARTBEAT-freshness rung (alive/dead; the generous direction is safe): the
    start floor does not gate freshness at all — freshness is about *now*, not
    the start window. A future-dated beat (clock skew / forged stamp) beyond the
    one-second slack is dropped (not clamped), failing toward STALLED.

Every degrade path fails toward STALLED/SPINNING and never raises (the ADM
fail-closed analogue): a `_CORRUPT` sentinel, an unparseable `ts`, an empty or
absent journal — none can invent progress or freshness. `saw_corrupt` is carried
for a future renderer's data-quality note (Phase 3); it does NOT flip the
verdict (the count-0/age-None degrade already fails safe) and is not threaded
into the (byte-unchanged) `ProgressEvidence`.
