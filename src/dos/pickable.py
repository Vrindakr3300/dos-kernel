"""`pickable` — the pre-dispatch gate (docs/168 Concept 2).

The kernel already owns four ground-truth syscalls (`verify`/`oracle`,
`arbitrate`, `liveness`, `scout`/`loop_decide`). But a fleet's throughput is
lost *before a worker launches* to a question the kernel did not yet own:

  > "Is there anything here a worker could actually pick up — and if not, *why
  > not*, precisely enough to route?"

The `job` host answered this in its own code
(`fanout_state._phase_universe_has_pickable_phase`,
`next_up_context._attach_pick_gates`, `plan_pickability._phase_gate_reason`),
and every bug in that re-implementation was a fleet-wide wedge: the drain-trap
(FQ-493 / ASI #475 / RTN / FMP — the pick-count oracle counted a DEFERRED /
DRAFT / operator-gated phase as *pickable*), the FQ-420 un-typed gate-set, the
picker-invisibility gap. The `picker_oracle` module is a **post-hoc audit** that
reconstructs ground truth *after* a dispatch emitted a verdict, to *measure*
picker precision/recall — it is NOT a pre-dispatch gate the picker can call to
decide what to offer. This module is that gate.

The relationship to `picker_oracle`:

  * `pickable.classify`  → the **pre-flight gate** — decide what to offer.
  * `picker_oracle`      → the **post-flight audit** — was the gate right?

They share ONE vocabulary. `HoldReason` is the FINER closed set; it collapses to
the coarse `picker_oracle.NoPickCause` via `.to_no_pick_cause`, so the gate and
the audit can never drift (the same `gate_classify` → `dispatch-loop` shape that
already worked). Concretely: a `HELD(OPERATOR_GATED)` pre-flight is exactly the
case `picker_oracle` audits as `OPERATOR_GATE` — one enum, two consumers.

The keystone is `HoldReason.is_redispatch_invariant`. The single most expensive
recurring mistake was a loop that kept re-dispatching a lane whose *only* hold
reason was one a re-dispatch cannot change (`DRAFT_CLASS`, `OPERATOR_GATED`,
`SOAK_OPEN`, `DEPENDENCY_UNMET`). `loop_decide` reads that flag and gains a clean
rung: a lane held only by re-dispatch-invariant reasons is STOP-now, not
continue — the honest-STOP that was a per-run human override becomes a kernel
rule (docs/168 §5; the same move docs/145 made for the stall reader).

⚓ Pure; host gathers state. Identical seam to `dos.scout.choose` reading a
sibling `HealthVerdict`: `classify(unit_state, …)` is `pure(state)`, all the I/O
(read the plan class, the soak index, the live claims) on the host adapter side.
The host's `_phase_universe_has_pickable_phase` becomes a thin
`all(classify(u, …).held for u in units)` instead of bespoke gate logic.

⚓ Degrade, never crash. A missing key in `unit_state` is treated as its falsy
default; `classify` never raises. The picker-invisibility gap was a *silent*
drop; the cure here is a typed verdict the picker can always produce.
